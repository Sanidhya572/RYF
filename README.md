![image](https://github.com/Sanidhya572/RYF/assets/84410647/e5ab36f0-1e64-4aa6-8b31-4b0ca70d89bc)


This project implements a content-based recommendation system and integrates it with Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications. Additionally, custom CSS has been added to enhance the user interface.

## Description

This recommendation system suggests items to users based on the similarity of item features. It analyzes the content of items (such as movies, articles, products) and recommends similar items based on their content. This approach is particularly useful when there is limited user interaction data available, as it relies solely on the characteristics of the items.

## Features

- Content-based filtering algorithm
- Streamlit integration for a user-friendly interface
- Custom CSS for improved aesthetics

## Usage
